GTA mediated HGT model2 - selection model

Xa: bacteria population without GTA and won't take GTA
Xn: bacteria population take GTA as "food"
Xr: bacteria population take GTA as "food" and integrate infected DNA fragments into their own genome

hypothesis: GTA mediated HGT will promote the recombination of the beneficial mutations 

PC version:
compile: g++ -o out *.cpp 
run program: ./out input.txt

modifying the parameters in "input.txt" to define the reaction system and processes

Cluster version:
#module load intel-compilers/15.0
compile: icc -O3 -mkl -I/opt/sprng/4.4/include -std=c++11 -o model_XaXnXr *.cpp /opt/sprng/4.4/lib/libsprng.a
